# UX Research Workflow Automation

> **Python automation tools for scaling UX research operations and streamlining data analysis workflows**

## 🎯 Why Automate UX Research?

**The Problem**: UX researchers spend 60-70% of their time on manual data processing, report formatting, and administrative tasks instead of generating insights and communicating with stakeholders.

**The Solution**: Python automation that handles repetitive work, allowing researchers to focus on strategic analysis and business impact.

## 🚀 What This Repository Demonstrates

### Technical Skills
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for survey data cleaning and analysis
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly for automated chart generation
- **Text Analysis**: Natural language processing for feedback categorization
- **Automation**: Workflow tools that save hours per research project

### Business Impact
- **Time Savings**: 3-hour manual tasks → 15-minute automated processes
- **Scalability**: Handle larger sample sizes without proportional time increases
- **Consistency**: Standardized analysis approaches across all research projects
- **Quality**: Reduced human error in data processing and reporting

## 📊 Automation Tools Included

### 1. Survey Data Processor
